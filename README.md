# BlackStarMod

I don't like single use batteries and wanted to change my little practice amp into something more practical. 

# Materials Required
- Battery Charge and Voltage regulator board [https://a.co/d/e1zACxr]
- External USB header [https://a.co/d/aeOcBL6]
- 18650 Battery
- 18650 Battery Holder [https://a.co/d/2Ov5wxS]
- Blackstar Fly Amp
- Solder / Soldering Iron

# Todo
- Add photos
- Add external LED charge status LED
- 3D print something to hold stuff in place instead of hot glue. 

# Instructions
- Solder battery holder leads to battery charge / voltage regulator board
- insert 18650 battery into holder
- Plug into USB to verify that it turns red or yellow to indicate charging or fully charged
- Remove battery holder from back of amp ( 2 screws )
- Remove back of amp ( 4 screws )
- Clip red and black leads from AA battery holder
- Solder red and black leads to + and - on battery charge / voltage regulator board
- With battery at full charge, turn on amp and all should be good.  If not while the amp is powered on, turn the adjustment pot until the amp LED turns on. If you have a multimeter you can probe the output ( with the amp on ) and shoot for 5-6v
- Hot glue everything in place. 
- Drill hole in back of the amps battery compartment for the panel mount USB connector
- Screw in the connector and attach to the USB input of the battery charge board
- Screw the case back together
- Rock on.
